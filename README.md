# devicefingerprinting
My code written for my master thesis, to analyse big data capturing user device fingerprinting by European news media websites

I have used Harvest data from one of my professors, ran the files of sizes of more than 20 gbs through SQLite and generated CSVs filtering the data that was relevant for my Master thesis topic.

I also separated the data into 3 different periods to analyze changes over time and in whole.

I used those files to analyze and generate reports in my Python Scripts.

This code can be used for inspiration, learning and ideas, but it cannot be used to generate some output unless there is the raw data or csv files.
